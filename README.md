# Arlo the Ordinary Hedgehog

## Project Description

This repo is for a website for a childrens' book Kayla Nerby (my wife) is working on publishing. The book is titled *Arlo the Ordinary Hedgehog*. Since the book and website aren't published, certain details of the project may be placeholders rather than a finalized, ready to publish website.

## Features Included for Code Louisville Front-End

### Basic Requirements

* The project is still being worked on, but I will list the requirements fulfilled in this section as they are met.
* The navigation menu collapses to a vertical, touch friendly menu at smaller screen widths
* Flexbox is being utilized in conjunction with media queries in the main content area of the home page and in the header and footer to change the layout at different screen sizes
* ":nth child" or similar pseudo elements are being used to style the navigation menu and the first lines and letters of paragraphs
* The art gallery page will feature an image carousel

### Additional Requirements

* The project is still being worked on, but I will list the requirements fulfilled in this section as they are met.
* Responsive to devices: the layout of the site has been built using a mobile first approach, but changes as the display width expands to match the content
* CSS elements: custom-written css in a separate css file has been used throughout the project for styling
* A separate .js file will be linked to support the image carousel feature
* The CSS and JS files have comments throughout to break down sections or explain things
